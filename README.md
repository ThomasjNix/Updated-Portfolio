<h1>Welcome to my new Portfolio!</h1>

<p>Why a new portfolio? Well, you can view my old portfolio <a href="https://github.com/ThomasjNix/portfolio-live">here</a>. As much as I enjoyed building that portfolio, I felt it was a good time that I refactor everything, applying some of the new tech I've learned. Here's some updates I'm excited about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Switch to Google Materialize styling for more minimalistic design</li>
    <li>Better mobile responsivity</li>
    <li>Dynamic loading of content with Angular2+</li>
    <li>Angular Material2 components for better page feel and quality</li>
    <li>Examples of projects with images</li>
    <li>Direct contact form</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's just the beginning! I'm looking forward to building this sleek, fast, and attractive portfolio as I learn more.</p>

<p>Structure</p>
<ul>
    <li>Back end: NodeJS, ExpressJS</li>
    <li>Front end: Angular 2+, Google Materialize, Angular Material2 design</li>
    <li>Database interaction: <em>TBD</em> (I'm not saying it's not PostgreSQL)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Happy Coding!</h3>
